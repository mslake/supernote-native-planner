# supernote-native-planner
A native .note planner for Supernote A5X e-ink tablet

Supernote currently does not support full note taking capabilities within a linked PDF planner document.  This project is to create a native .note template that is linked as a functional planner.  The year, quarter and month pages of the note are all cross linked.  A daily template page is created for each month that can be copied and pasted as a new day to maintain links.  Titles on the daily pages can build a robust table of contents.

I have included a planner.note template to get started.  For those looking to improve on this, I included the layered GIMP files and .png template files.

To do:
- Clean up the link handwriting
- Static links to calendar sections from the daily note
- 2024 version
- Weekly links
- Daily links

A sample of a daily copy / paste page might look like this, with static quick links to other project notes:

The annual calendar, linked to months and quarters:

The quarterly calendar pages linked to months and annual:

The monthly calendar, linked to quarters, adjacent months and annual.  There are no links to specific days, though you could add links to your daily pages if you like, which wsa a limitation of using a PDF file.
